I like reading, and love learning. I find myself often with more resources than I can share. Often ending up spaming the company's Slack channels with links. So, I decided to keep a log of articles/links/courses that I come across each day.

I've often found traffic readings on [my very old and empty site](https://ammarasmaro.com). So might as well add to it. I think that it is actually bad for SEO to just include a million links on your site but I still like the idea so I'll try it out.
